Challenge 9: The human being
----------------------------

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence in the world involves
existential and psychological questions that need to be addressed as
they affect the possibility of perceiving, understanding and acting in
the world. These also alter how human beings are individually positioned
in relation to the society and the environment, with substantial impacts
on rights, freedoms and opportunities for personal and professional
fulfilment.

AI ​​is already present in many environments, services and processes of
our everyday life: the technologies we use to mediate relationships with
other human beings, the objects and places in which we live. AI
influences behaviour, methods of working, learning, communicating and
having fun. All of us have, more or less consciously, faced this
reality, even if on AI ​​there are still perplexities due to the lack of
understanding of the technology itself and of its real effects in the
society.

In this lack of knowledge, which is present at all levels of society and
education, it is easy that a narration made of distorted news or
influenced by despotic fiction is inserted. These risks to negatively
affect the collective imagination, degenerating into distortions of
reality typical of the self-fulfilling prophecy theory [1]_.

Several empirical and sociological studies, and social psychology
experiments [2]_, have repeatedly shown how radical these capabilities
of intervention can be on imagination.

Therefore, these are actions that have an impact on the psychological,
social and existential spheres. Laws, regulations and good technical and
technological practices (though necessary) are not enough to guide the
citizens: a narration and an imagination built by society in an
inclusive way outlining the meanings of AI ​​and the roles we want to
assign it are required.

Contemporary society, characterized by strong digitalisation, has the
task of creating the prerequisites for which people can develop,
together and responsibly, a vision of the world that is coherent with
the innovations that these technologies bring with them. In this sense,
the value of social sciences and of public communication is enhanced
even more compared to the construction of a predominantly strategic
narration. If the future is the consequence of the choices made in the
present we cannot raise the issue, leaving unattended the interpretation
of technological development and of its social consequences.

There are several approaches that, in a transdisciplinary way,
contribute to the construction of a scenario that facilitates the
understanding and involvement of the human being in the introduction of
AI solutions.

Design, arts, psychology, anthropology, sociology and other humanistic
disciplines can and must create links between research, industry and
society, to support pedagogical initiatives capable of helping different
communities to understand the boundaries and implications of these
technologies.

On the one hand, art and design have always played a crucial role in
involving people in a common narrative. On the other hand, they allowed
the great processes of innovation suggested by not focusing on needs,
but on aspirations [3]_, desire and imagination. Historically, Art has
helped to draw new imaginations and open new opportunities, raising the
level of criticism and causing the participation and involvement of
people, crossing cultures, social classes, professions and skills.

This role [4]_ is finally recognized also at European level, thanks to
programs that use the arts to bring innovations into the common
imagination, contributing to build a positive social meaning, which is
shared and above all aware of the advantages and uses of innovations.

The non-secondary effect of this approach is, in economic terms, the
creation of new markets; in social terms, instead, it generates greater
participation, solidarity, a sense of belonging to a cosmopolitan world.

Offering its citizens the opportunity to socially build a shared
imagination of the role of technologies such as AI, is of fundamental
importance not only in terms of social inclusion but above all as a
citizenship investment. A conscious citizen, who understands and feels
understood, is a citizen whose sense of belonging generates greater
trust in institutions. The citizen participating in public action and to
the proposed solutions, inclined to support and constructive criticism
of the government activities, is able - with different levels of
involvement - to support the design of always better systems and
solutions, in a context increasingly free from digital and cultural
divides.

Historically, Italy has played an exemplary role in innovating through
beauty, aesthetics and well-being and in stimulating leading cultural
and social processes.

Innovative by tradition, as a Nation we must not give up to bring the
characteristic features of Italian style (design, creativity,
aesthetics) within this narration of the system, still to be built but
focused on the well-being of people.

A vision that constitutes for our Nation an international competitive
advantage, built on the ability to “imagine the world”. For this reason,
it is necessary to create and support initiatives in which artists and
designers work side by side with AI researchers, humanists, engineers
and managers.

   pronounced makes the event presumed, expected or predicted, thus
   confirming its own veracity” (RKM, Self-fulfilling prophecy, in

   capable of involving hundreds of thousands of people, schools and
   universities, artists and designers of all disciplines, researchers
   and industries. Not to mention the initiatives among the most
   prestigious universities in the world such as MIT, Stanford, Carnegie

   research programs.
