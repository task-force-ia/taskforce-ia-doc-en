Challenge 4: Role of data
-------------------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools are benefiting today
from the enormous amount of data that is generated daily by IT systems.
The quality and interoperability of this data are a determining factor
for the possibility of applying new technologies. Among the main AI
techniques that can be used to process such data, for example, is that
of so-called *supervised learning*. In this case, the data must be
“annotated” by humans who teach the machines how to interpret it. This
operation is very onerous since it requires a conspicuous and complex
amount of human work. In addition to the lengthy process necessary to
perform this annotation work, the discretion of the annotators could
generate inconsistent datasets (i.e.: similar data annotated in a
different way), weakening the operation of the machines and propagating
errors.

The challenge associated with the role of data is therefore the creation
of conditions, including organisational conditions, that allow
Artificial Intelligence to use correctly created databases, where
consistency, quality and intelligibility are guaranteed.

In the *Internet of Things* field, one of the main challenges to be
addressed is that the data collected by interconnected devices and
sensors is different from that with which the scientific community of
data scientists has had to deal with in the past. In fact, the greatest
successes that have been achieved in the AI field regard applications
such as image processing, autonomous driving and web search that have
been made possible thanks to the availability of large and relatively
structured datasets, able to be used therefore in training machine
learning algorithms. On the contrary, data coming from a multitude of
connected devices can be fragmented, heterogeneous and distributed
irregularly in space and time: a challenge of rare complexity for anyone
who wants to analyse data in a structured manner.

A second area of discussion is the management and research of data
published on the web in the form of linked open data [1]_. This data,
which may regard both the institutional task of a public body (e.g. land
registry or administrative data) as well as its operation (e.g. internal
data) is made accessible and usable through open formats. While
representing a mine of information, the data needs adequate tools to be
exploited to its full potential. In particular, information retrieval
and filtering models and methods are needed [2]_ based on semantic
technologies and shared ontologies. This work, already envisaged by the
DAC and launched within the scope of the activities of the Digital Team,
will be part of the broader perspective of conceptual governance of
public information assets.

Once the conditions for the proper functioning of the Artificial
Intelligence methodologies have been created, one of the tasks of Public
Administration will be to aggregate the data necessary to support
process improvement. This could be achieved through the creation of an
open platform for the collection, generation and management of certain
types of data, directly related to Public Administration [3]_. The
decentralised use of public datasets, essential for the development of
active participation practices (civic activism), in turn requires
specific capabilities of governance of the socio-technical system of
Public Administration. It is in fact essential that data quality is
ensured at source, through the generalised adoption of guidelines and
appropriate content standards.

To achieve these ambitious objectives, there are many issues to be
addressed, including some that have been appearing in the e-government
plans of developed countries for many years. These include:

-  data distribution and access methods;

-  design and definition of shared ontologies;

-  supervision of public dataset quality;

-  estimate of the economic value attributable to the data;

-  tools that allow citizens to monitor data production;

-  management and promotion of data access [4]_;

-  regulation of data usage [5]_.

The last three items of the list just presented introduce a further
issue for PA: making sure that anyone who wants to develop Artificial
Intelligence solutions useful for citizens can have equal and
non-discriminatory access to the necessary data [6]_.
