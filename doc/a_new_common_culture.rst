A new common culture for the innovation of public services
==========================================================

Artificial Intelligence will redesign our lives. Our daily lives of human beings, citizens, workers, parents, and children are changing before everyone’s eyes. Indeed, we can be sure that our customs will soon be reshaped consequently generating social changes that require an individual and collective reflection and in some cases, perhaps, even an upset reflection.

Technology is neutral by itself but it is not so in its application and it is even less neutral for those who, working on the development of societies, often find themselves deciding what is right or wrong or, in a given context, what is the best good or the least harm.
The spirit with which the Agency for Digital Italy has undertaken this commitment is summarized in these few lines.
The aim of the pages that will follow the preface of this White Paper is the study, analysis, and the understanding of the opportunities and risks generated by the dissemination of Artificial Intelligence technologies in the public sector: hence, the definition of a shared perimeter within which to face all the challenges that this brings.

This document marks the beginning of a journey that the Italian Public Administration has already started: in recent months, we have created a community with which we have identified the working lines that can help us define the approach to Artificial Intelligence in the public sector that we are committed to transform into operational steps.

After this first phase of study, analysis, and comparison I firmly believe that never before it has been more urgent to create a platform where Public Administration and Market can define a common value-based framework. It is pivotal to have a clear model of technological development as well as a vision capable of contrasting the apocalyptic, exclusionary and non-governed scenarios.

This consideration, which is the leitmotif of the White Paper, comes from the knowledge that Public Administration needs - for the sake of its decisions - to be competitive on these issues. Today, more than ever, those who understand and govern technological change continue on the path of innovation; those who simply cope with technological change will lose ground.

This is why the work which just begun represents both a condition to face the use of emerging technologies that allow the Public Administration to capitalize on current innovative infrastructure projects and the basis for the development of future projects.

The recommendations published in this document aim at being building blocks for the design of new services as well as methodological assets to guide the development of pilot projects. In addition, the recommendation will also serve for the innovative result of the technologies that will be implemented and for the common value approach. Only by following this path we will succeed in relating the benefits of Artificial Intelligence in the daily “practice” of citizens.
