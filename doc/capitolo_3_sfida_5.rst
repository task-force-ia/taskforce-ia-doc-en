Challenge 5: Legal context
--------------------------

When it comes to regulating the activity of Public Administration, one of the fundamental issues is the balance between the interests of the community and those of the individual.

In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensuring this balance is particularly complex. The most advanced AI techniques require huge amounts of data to be effective, therefore, there is considerable economic interest in collecting sensitive data and it is necessary
to analyse some of the main legal issues that may concern AI. Among these are the principle of transparency of administrative acts, legal liability, privacy, information security and intellectual property [1]_.

Transparency is one of the key principles of Public Administration, therefore it must also inspire the design of new public services based on AI solutions. For this purpose, it is pivotal to ensure the  transparency of the algorithms and of the design process databases as well as to clearly define the related responsibilities [2]_.

Today, AI algorithms can directly influence public assessments, decisions , and the administrative procedures themselves. This raises the issue of accountability, and highlights new challenges for the Public Administration:

- finding methods that are compatible with the current set of rules so that the administration can explain how AI systems have processed information;

- indicating the sources of data and informing the managers of administrative procedures about the processing methods used by the AI systems.

To ensure the utmost transparency, citizens must be enabled to understand through which path the AI system has reached a certain result [3]_, in a sufficiently clear way to possibly recognize a calculation error and to intervene to correct it.
The use of sensitive data by Public Administration AI systems can compromise citizens’ right to privacy, as well as certain fundamental rights of the individual, in the event that the data collected is used to forecast events of social interest, from traffic management to crime prevention. One of the challenges is to avoid the use of data in the public sector generating pervasive social control in contrast with fundamental citizens’ rights [4]_.

As for the possible “threat” to the privacy rights, it may be necessary to implement certain principles and tools that are also included in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), such as the Data Protection Impact Assessment and Privacy by Design. The first requires those who use IT tools, which may violate the right to privacy, to make a prior assessment of the impact of these technologies on the protection of personal data. The second is based on the idea that privacy must be embedded into the design of AI systems , ensuring anonymisation and pseudonymisation of data that should not be held or further used unless this is essential for reasons that were clearly stated in advance to support data privacy.

The challenge is clearly to find a balance between the effective use of Artificial Intelligence at the service of the citizens and respect for their right to privacy, giving them the opportunity to express their informed consent to the processing of data by intelligent systems.

To ensure that the AI solutions acquired (or developed) by the Public Administration comply with the provisions of the current legislation, it is necessary to carefully monitor the procurement procedures for goods and services. In particular, the administration shall compare different solutions available on the market, and eventually open specific consultations.

Furthermore, it is recommended that - in the event of a tender - the requirements and characteristics of AI solutions are precisely defined, with particular reference to compliance with the current legislation, so as to always guarantee the legitimacy of the administration’s activities.

   For this purpose, the Digital Administration Code (DAC) has established the figure of the digital ombudsman, to whom citizens can send reports and complaints in case of non-compliance or violations related to the use of digital systems by public administration.

   Jurisprudence has already established that - in the case in which algorithms are used for administrative activities - the right of access to the algorithm must always be guaranteed (Ref. sentence TAR Regional Administrative Court Lazio-Roma, Sect. III-bis, no. 3769/2017).
