Challenge 5: Legal context
--------------------------

When it comes to regulating the activity of Public Administration, one of the fundamental 
problems is the balance between the interests of the community and those of the individual. 
In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensuring this balance is particularly complex. 
The most advanced AI techniques require huge amounts of data to be effective. There is 
therefore considerable economic interest in collecting sensitive data and it is necessary 
to analyse some of the main legal issues that may concern AI. Among these: the principle 
of transparency of administrative acts, legal liability, privacy, information security and 
intellectual property [1]_.

Within the scope of Public Administration activities, the principle of transparency is cardinal 
and therefore must also inspire the design of new public services based on AI solutions. For 
this purpose, the criteria to be used undoubtedly include transparency of the algorithms, 
the construction logic of the databases on which they operate and defining the related 
responsibilities [2]_.

Today, AI algorithms can directly influence public assessments and decisions Already, as 
well as the administrative procedures themselves. This poses a problem of accountability, 
i.e. verifying the actual legal liability upstream of certain decisions or results, posing a series 
of challenges for Public Administration:

-  find methods that are uniform and compatible with the current system so that the administration can justify its actions, also in the part processed by AI systems.

-  indicate the data sources that feed AI and through which it has made its assessments, and make the managers of administrative procedures aware of the processing methods used by AI systems.


To ensure utmost transparency, citizens must be enabled to understand through which path the AI system has reached a certain result [3]_, in a sufficiently clear way to possibly recognize a calculation error and to intervene to correct it.

The use of sensitive data by Public Administration AI systems can compromise citizens’ 
right to privacy, as well as certain fundamental rights of the individual, in the event that 
the data collected is used to forecast events of social interest, from traffic management 
to crime prevention. One of the challenges is to avoid that the use of data by PA generates 
pervasive social control in contrast with fundamental citizens’ rights [4]_.

As for the possible “threat” of the right to privacy, it may be necessary to implement certain 
principles and tools present in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
such as the Data Protection Impact Assessment and Privacy by Design. The former requires 
those who use IT tools that may violate the right to privacy to make a prior assessment of 
the impact of these technologies on the protection of personal data. The latter is based on 
the idea that the rules on the protection of personal data must be already incorporated in 
the software design phase, ensuring that the identification data of citizens is anonymous 
or covered by pseudonym, reduced to the minimum necessary and that its use is limited to 
specific purposes.

The challenge is clearly to find a balance between the effective use of Artificial Intelligence 
at the service of citizens and respect for their right to privacy, giving them the opportunity 
to express their informed consent to the processing of data by intelligent systems.
To ensure that the AI solutions acquired (or developed) by the Public Administration comply 
with the provisions of the current regulations, it is necessary to carefully monitor the 
procurement procedures for goods and services. In particular, it is appropriate that - before 
the decision to contract - the administration proceeds to the comparative verification of 
the solutions available on the market, possibly proceeding to appropriate consultations. 
Furthermore, it is recommended that - in the event of a tender - the requirements and 
characteristics of AI solutions are precisely defined, with particular reference to compliance 
with applicable laws, so as to always guarantee the legitimacy of the administration’s 
activities.
