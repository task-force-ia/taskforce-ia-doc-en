Chapter 1 - Italy and digital services
======================================

Introduction
------------

The aim of this White Paper is to analyse the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on our society and, specifically, how these technologies can be used by Public Administration (PA) to improve services for citizens and businesses. This is a part of a broader framework of the policies to be implemented by the public sector to facilitate the digital transformation that works as the engine of social, economic and cultural development.

To accelerate this transformation process, it is possible to draw inspiration from international experiences that have brought tangible results: Italy must excel in the search for innovative strategies, perhaps be able to feed on the historical, cultural and social wealth of the country and the Mediterranean, and at the same time, succeed in seizing the best that has emerged from the strategies of those countries that were the first in making the evolution of public information technology the lever for transition to a new global structure of the economy and society.

It is therefore necessary to support the country’s innovation forces in order to obtain increasingly competitive models and to initiate a radical change in the relationship between citizens, administrations and the market. The ultimate goal of this process is the creation of modern, easy to use, accessible and high-quality public services therefore oriented to the understanding of users’ needs thus allowing the level of citizen satisfaction and trust in the institutions to be increased.

The document intends to outline the development prospects of digital public services and the challenges that the country will have to face to implement and use the new technologies while respecting ethics and laws, putting the citizen at the centre of this evolutionary path.

An overview of digital government in Italy
------------------------------------------

Before describing the state of the art and the future prospects of Artificial Intelligence in our society and in Public Administration, it may be useful to analyse what is happening in the field of digital transformation in the public sector, in order to understand the current situation and imagine how AI can create synergies with the process of digitising the country.

| According to data reported in the last Report of the Organization for Economic          |
| Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Digital Transformation 1, our country is          |
| in 5th place worldwide for the production of the most cited scientific documents        |
| on machine learning after the United States, China, India and Great Britain             |
| (science, innovation and digital revolution). Also in the same Report (section on       |
| growth, work and digital transformation), 2015 data on the dissemination of industrial  |
| robots show that Italy is among the leading economies in Europe (behind Germany,        |
| Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and Slovenia) in terms of use of robots (ex. number     |
| of robots compared to the value added in manufacturing), while showing indices equal to |
| 1/3 compared to those of the world leader (South Korea).                                |

As highlighted by the Digital Economy and Society Index - DESI 2017 [2]_, Italy improved its ranking, but there is still a gap between the supply of digital services and their actual use. Our country has nevertheless made progress on connectivity, a basic condition to allow the development of a digital ecosystem, also thanks to the Ultra Broadband Plan [3]_.

According to the data of the Annual Report of the Italian Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM), at present 90.7% of families in which there is at least one minor have a fixed and mobile broadband connection, a figure that reaches only 20.7% for households aged over 65.

At the same time, 91.6% of households with at least one graduate member have a broadband connection, a figure that falls to 55.3% for families where the highest qualification is the middle school certificate.
This, once again, highlights the centrality of demand, and not just supply, in stimulating the dissemination of internet-based technologies in Italy.

Data on the Italian dynamism of startups and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) confirms the importance of the “demand factor”. In our country, according to a census updated to 2017 [4]_there are over 8.000 innovative startups and SMEs, twice the number compared to 2015, employing 46.107 people, including shareholders and employees. The digital market is growing and the ICT sector is undergoing a development phase thanks to the increase in investments: in 2016, it grew by 1.8% to reach Euro 66 billion in turnover [5]_.

Additionally it is growing the demand for high-level digital skills, in a context in which only 29% of the workforce possesses them compared to the EU average of 37% [6]_.

As for digital public services, the DESI confirms that Italy is positioned at the top of the ranking in terms of quantitative supply but online services are not fully widespread all over the Country and a small number of people use online forms. Also Eurostat partly confirms this fact: despite the majority of Italians expressed the need for a more streamlined relationship with the Public Administration [7]_, the tools available are used only by 13% of citizens compared to the European average of 30% [8]_.

The Italian digital strategy
----------------------------

In the context of the European Digital Agenda, Italy has developed its national strategy by converting the EU objectives into initiatives aimed at the digital transformation of the Public Administration [9]_.

By doing so, the interventions in the public sector become the driving force for business development and the growth of citizens’ skills. The 2014-2020 strategy of the Digital Agenda has therefore become a veritable tool to pursue the great objectives of growth, employment, quality of life and democratic participation.

But the challenges of digital transformation have changed quickly: Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain are the vectors of digital economy. To further address these issues, in 2017 the three-year plan for information technology in the Public Administration [10]_was approved. The Plan contains operating indications (actions, times and objectives) for the development of four pillars: digital ecosystems or policy areas (health, school, justice, etc.), intangible infrastructures (including enabling platforms and PA data), physical infrastructures and cybersecurity. The Plan was created to effectively guide the digital transformation of the country, becoming a reference for central and local administrations in the development of their information systems.

It sets the fundamental architectural principles, the rules of usability and interoperability and rationalises ICT expenditure. 

Tackling these challenges imposes, however, the identification of a new technical, ethical and regulatory framework that could enable the public sector to address and manage new scenarios, ameliorating the efficiency and effectiveness of existing projects and providing tools and skills for the future ones. At the same time, it is necessary to define how to stimulate and accompany the cultural evolution of the country, involve the population, overcome diversity, reticence and conflict, and identify new perspectives. The use of Artificial Intelligence tools applied to public services, the main subject of this White Paper, is only one of the sectors in which Italy is trying to achieve the objectives of the Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in Public Administration. For this specific purpose, the “Artificial Intelligence Task Force at the service of the citizens” [11]_ was set up to discuss the new opportunities presented by using AI in our daily life and, more specifically, in the development of a new relationship between the State and the citizens.
