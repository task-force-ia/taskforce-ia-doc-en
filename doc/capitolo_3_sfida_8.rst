Challenge 8: Measuring the impact
---------------------------------

“Change has never happened this fast before, and it will never be this slow again” [1]_.
The introduction of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the society and, in particular, in the Public Administration, brings with it the natural desire to measure and understand its social impacts, risks and opportunities.

It is now essential to measure the impact of AI public policies on both  citizens, and the PA. Regarding the citizens, the focus is on improving people’s quality of life and the level of accessibility and usability of tools and services provided. 

The measurement of the impact of the use of Artificial Intelligence on the PA implies the use of both qualitative and quantitative indicators. For instance, the methods are related to measuring customer satisfaction (e.g. social impact, well-being of citizens, accessibility and usability of the tools) or related to the optimization of organizational processes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Many quantitative models analyse employed persons by detailed occupation and try to hypothesize which professions will be replaced by technologies, in other words these models base their operation by considering jobs and employment as a unit of analysis [2]_.
However, often technology does not completely replace a professional figure but only some specific activities. Workers who had previously held a particular task are therefore addressed and reassigned to complementary activities that imply the use of new technologies. Over time, technology leads to a complete rethinking of organizational processes and objectives.
Given the complexity of the phenomenon to be analysed, the measurement of the impact requires the use of a multidisciplinary approach, which allows defining the impact from an anthropological, psychological and sociological point of view, as well as from the technological and econometric point of view too.

For this reason it is necessary to identify new sets of multidisciplinary indicators to be used in synergy with the indicators existing today.

In any case, it is necessary to keep in mind that the methods adopted to measure the impact can promote a better understanding of the public services by the users and encourage the transition to new governance models [3]_.
Mapping the needs and defining the impact objectives with the involvement of all the relevant actors and collecting real-time information on the interactions of network nodes, are the first essential steps in understanding and defining correct policy assessments.

Unfortunately, these assessments are not updated as frequently as they should be, due to financial limitations or unavailability of expert evaluators. As policy assessment is commonly based on data, AI could enable a faster and more accurate analysis.

A greater balance in the analysis of opportunities and risks could be an important factor to increase awareness of the real impact [4]_. that AI can have in our daily lives.

Finally, measuring the impact of these technologies is useful in terms of designing and developing AI, in order to guarantee reliability and transparency as well as to reduce the risk of errors, which also regards the Public Administration [5]_.
Analysing how these technologies work can help us identify valid models for an ethical and responsible use of AI.
Measurement tools must be strict to determine the effective social impacts of AI and to define how these technologies can actually influence our lives.
