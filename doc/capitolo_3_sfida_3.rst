Challenge 3: Skills
-------------------

While we are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools daily (e.g. chatbots, virtual assistants and automated traffic calculation and management systems), applications of AI in professional contexts or in the public sector are still uncommon  [1]_.

The world of work is going through a profound transformation and existing professions will evolve: new ones will be required, while the existing ones will be extensively modified with the introduction of new processes and methodologies [2]_.

People will need to learn how to design and develop AI systems and applications, also in direct and deep collaboration with researchers and major technology operators.

In the same way, it will be pivotal to develop adequate skills to foster the interaction between human beings and AI, which will become increasingly complex by virtue of the possibility of touching the language, gestures, body, emotions and many other expressive dimensions of mankind [3]_.

The consolidation of skills is therefore crucial to be aligned with the great technological and socio-economic changes that the world is about to face, in order to be able to prepare young generations, but also adults, to seize future challenges.

How to develop these skills? The objective can be reached in different ways. It is possible to either train public and private workers, on both demand and supply side, or put the emphasis on the more general, but not less important, issue of improving the digital literacy level, so as to allow people to fully exploit digital services or focus on a more specialized and trans-disciplinary training.

Referring to the digital literacy, it is essential to help people understand what Artificial Intelligence is and what are the benefits and the risks of this technology, in order to enable them to make the best use of the public services and to foster a positive and optimistic approach to the new technologies avoiding the rejection of the unknown [4]_.

Furthermore, since natural user interfaces - such as speech, written text and gestures - are largely used to interact with AI systems, it is necessary to “educate” citizens with the aim of reducing the gap in access to such technologies.
This is primarily connected to the capacity of the school system, to face these changes and to effectively train the citizens and workers of the future.

Currently, and probably still for many years, Artificial Intelligence will be able to perform rather simple tasks.
It is urgent, though, that the school and the university systems prepare students for the future. That is, student needs to develop problem solving, analysis and synthesis skills, as well as well as critical thinking , creativity, empathic interaction, sensory and psychomotor capacities, that are all skills in which we do not need to compete against machines. 
It clearly emerges that a memorisation-based knowledge , as well as teaching methods that prioritise the amount of information delivered rather than critical education are progressively losing importance.

Regarding the specialist and trans-disciplinary training for public and private professionals who intend to work in the AI sector, it is important to prioritise training in multidisciplinary contexts, providing them with the skills that are fundamental to fully understand the impact of the systems they develop on people’s lives.

At the moment, in addition to technical experts in specific disciplines such as machine learning and data science, it is crucial to cooperate with psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists and humanists in general, who can contribute to improving the interaction between AI and its users. They can better understand how the AI can be integrated and improve in everyday life, as well as establish meaningful interconnections among different disciplines, so as to create new generations of designers who are able to set up excellent technological systems that are also able to generate meaning and a tangible increase in economic, cultural, social and psychological dimensions of well-being.

There is currently a disproportion between the demand for specialists in the field of advanced technologies and the availability of adequate skills. Thus, the private sector is willing to pay very high salaries to attract the best talent and to compete in the innovation market.

A challenge of PA will be to retain researchers and professionals, albeit not being able to compete with the salary levels offered by the private sector [5]_.

Human resources equipped with adequate skills are fundamental to introduce new technologies in the public sector that need to avoid being dependent on external suppliers.

Therefore, permanent and specialist training mechanisms will be required at all levels. It is necessary to integrate the debate on the replacement of the workforce with the analysis of the new market needs and how the adequate human resources training can impact the quality of both private and public services .

The integration of AI in training programmes can contribute to increasing human abilities, supporting decision making and facilitating the possibility of engaging in more specialised or more creative activities.
One of the objectives of Artificial Intelligence applied to cognitive systems is precisely that of increasing human abilities.

As a result, it is necessary to develop a profound awareness of the implications of the inevitable programming and calibration errors of such systems, that in exalting some of the aspects of the information available could inadvertently deform the importance or meaning.
Public Administration must become real propeller of innovation: just as the Industry Plan 4.0 [6]_, describes skills and resources that will allow companies to keep up with the market, the Public Administration shall envisage a plan to expand the skills of civil servants and innovate digital services [7]_.

   With this in mind, it will be essential to focus not only on training/updating of personnel but also on the ability to attract and retain resources with skills that can support the adoption of AI solutions in the public sector.
