Challenge 6: Accompanying the transformation
--------------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is both a technological and social innovation, since it encompasses benefits and complexities that can radically transform society, including the public sector. This technology, can contribute to improving the quality of the services and to reinforcing the trust relationship between administration and citizen.

The opportunities offered by AI can tender the public sector more efficient and improve user satisfaction. To exploit these opportunities and to ensure that citizens fully understand their advantages and potential, it is also necessary to deal with issues concerning governance, the use of new technologies and the ability to manage data.

It has to be taken into consideration that  our country  is populated by a large number of “intermediaries” in the relationship between citizens/businesses and the Public Administration. This, combined with a culture of “delegation”, often creates a real barrier that hinders the relationship between users and institutions.
Given this situation, it will be crucial to invest in the use of digital services to foster a new and reinforced relationship between citizens/businesses and the Public Administration.

Furthermore, the transformation process we are witnessing shall foresee capacity building activities aimed at strengthening the capacity of the leaders to promote the use of artificial intelligence solutions, as well as the capacity of public officials to implement them.
AI can be used to support, a series of activities such as:

    - completing complex tasks;

    - dispatching citizens’ requests and answering their questions;

    - effectively managing large amounts of data;

    - combining information from different datasets;

    - providing faster answers based on predictive scenarios;

    - automating repetitive processes;

    - analysing data that includes text/audio and video information [1]_.

Finally, the integration of AI in public services can contribute to improving workforce productivity, and supporting the decision-making process without replacing human judgment. The most evident benefits come alongside with the opportunity to rely on systems that can learn how to accurately support the decision-making process , and can free up time for employees to perform more specialised activities or tasks that require greater creativity and empathy. In doing so, services become more efficient, relations with citizens are improved and the level of trust in institutions is increased.

The introduction of AI in people’s lives requires the design of processes that facilitate the users to understand these technologies, not only through the use of experimentation but also through collaboration mechanisms that allow citizens to participate in the design of AI platforms.

Thanks to the co-creational approach, as it happens in design thinking, users perceive a sense of ownership of technology and appear to be more prone to use it. Moreover, where issues or problems in its use are found, citizens show a greater propensity to actively participate in their solution [2]_.

Design plays a key role in facilitating the engagement of citizens with the new AI-based public services. In fact, it represents the meeting point between technology and people.

Designers will have to create interfaces that do not just reproduce human actions, since this can generate alienation. They need to design interfaces able to establish a relationship of trust with citizens, using a language that is understandable and that puts them at ease [3]_.
 
The challenge will be to build flexible systems able to provide personalised answers, thus ensuring better and more efficient services. A specific characteristic of AI is indeed that of integrating data from multiple sources for dynamic modelling analysis. .
Another area on which the designers will have to focus will be the design of AI systems able to anticipate the needs of citizens without having an invasive approach that could compromise the user experience.

Another crucial element for introducing AI in a structured manner in the administration is the ability to manage data and to exploit the great wealth of information that PA possesses, facilitating not only interoperability, but also transparency and reliability.
Taking this into consideration, it is desirable that the application of AI technologies to the Public Administration aims at adopting shared ontologies in line with the internal organisation the relevant public body and with the services to be provided, developing controlled vocabularies able to interpret and interoperate the databases of national interest to the fullest [4]_.
In this regard, knowledge, representation and self-learning systems can be a valuable aid in increasing the accountability of the models. The adoption of collaborative methods can further ensure the use of models that are compatible with the PA and consistent with the regulatory framework.

In addition to the advantages described above, some criticalities in the adoption of AI in the public sector can be identified: in general, AI systems can be implemented successfully only if high data quality is guaranteed.
In terms of governance, the transformation process we are witnessing also involves the evolution of the relationship between public and private players.

Benefiting from AI in public services does not necessarily mean developing new solutions from scratch. On the contrary, it is possible to look at what has already been adopted by other governments, or draw on technologies already available on the market.

Public and private sectors can cooperate in the field of procurement. In this framework, AgID, for instance, has recently started the comparison and experimentation of new scenarios for the dissemination of Pre Commercial Procurement (PCP).
