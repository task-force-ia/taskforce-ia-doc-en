Recommendations
===============

Here is a list of recommendations, drawn up taking into account the 9 challenges presented 
in this document and the suggestions received through the public consultation.
These recommendations are not to be considered definitive or immutable, but they evolve 
with the continuous public debate on Artificial Intelligence.

1. **Promote** a national platform dedicated to the development of AI solutions in 
   order to: 
  a. promote the collection of annotated data, codes and learning models;
  b. organize and convey tests openly before the release of AI   systems used in 
     the PA in order to evaluate their behaviour and limit the anomalies and the 
     amplification of the bias;
  c. offer adequate computing resources to experiment with techniques and solutions;
  
2. **Disclose** to the public the intermediate results of the elaboration of AI 
   algorithms (ex. parameters of neural networks) operated on data from public 
   administrations, subject to conditions that may harm the privacy and security 
   of citizens. These results must allow the reproducibility of the processes, their 
   evaluation and verifiability; 

3. **Enable** with new resources the computational linguistic systems for the Italian 
   language (such as digitized lexicons or annotated corpora) to be distributed 
   with open licenses, in order to favour the development of services based on the 
   treatment of natural language;

4. **Develop** adaptive customization and recommendation systems that facilitate 
   interaction with the services offered by public administrations based on the 
   specific requirements, needs and characteristics of citizens. These systems can 
   also be used to identify critical issues that hinder the improvement of public 
   services;

5. **Promote** the creation of a National Competence Centre that is a point of reference 
   for the implementation of AI in the PA and that can provide predictions of impact 
   and measurement of the social and economic effects of AI systems, in order to 
   enhance the positive effects and reduce risks. The centre of competence must 
   also propose a Manifesto with the cardinal principles of the implementation of 
   AI in the PA;

6. **Facilitate** the dissemination of skills through the promotion of certification of 
   professionals working in the area of AI  (through the creation and adoption of a 
   shared framework ) and provide for the establishment of training paths for the 
   inclusion of workers with ability to understand and implement AI solutions in 
   the public administration (for example through specific courses at the National 
   School of Administration). The numerous professional skills lacking are an 
   opportunity to think about training courses focus on lasting and sustainable 
   gender equality, both from a numerical point of view (ex. STEM graduates) and 
   from a financial point of view (ex. remuneration equality); 

7. **Provide** a PA 4.0 plan to encourage PA investments in AI solutions starting 
   from a call for challenges through open innovation tools and procurement for 
   innovation;

8. **Support** the collaboration between research, business accelerators and 
   innovation hubs, both public and private, also at European level, to promote the 
   adoption of AI solutions in the public sector; 

9. **Establish** a Trans-disciplinary Centre on AI, in synergy with the Skills Centre, 
   which will have the following tasks:
   
   a. promote and disclose the debate on the evolution of ethics; 
   
   b. support critical reflection on emerging ethical issues; 
   
   c. improve the conditions for involving experts and citizens to transform technical 
      and social considerations into regulations, standards and technical solutions;

10. **Define** guidelines and processes based on the principle of security-by-design in 
    the use of AI, increasing the levels of control and facilitating the sharing of data 
    on cyber attacks to and from AI by all European countries.
