Challenge 2: Technology
-----------------------

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently not able to reproduce
the complex functioning of the human mind [1]_, but only approximate
some limited abilities [2]_, it is a discipline which, acquired over
sixty years of scientific, methodological and technological research,
has become pervasive in industry and society. Its models and methods can
certainly be conveniently used as tools for the implementation of
innovative solutions in complex socio-technical systems, such as that of
public administrations, provided that, together with the opportunities,
the limits of their scope of application are understood.

The new frontiers of particular interest for Public Administration are
those related to studies and research on how AI systems are able to
cooperate in the most effective way with human beings. This approach
exploits AI machine learning and adaptation capabilities to provide a
human-machine interaction that best meets the needs of users, their
interests and the real context in which they operate. It therefore
becomes important to conduct research consisting of methodological
investigation, modelling, implementation and testing of Artificial
Intelligence systems for various domains of interest to PA.

The distinctive characteristics of the “technological challenge” can
therefore be identified by two keywords: “personalisation” and
“adaptability”.

Overcoming this challenge means in fact being able to create PA systems
and services modelled on the multiple needs of citizens, able to evolve
with them, able to encourage personalised experiences.

This issue can be approached analytically by linking the most developed
sectors and technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence with
the activities and tasks typical of Public Administration.

The areas of use of “intelligent” technologies [3]_ in Public
Administration are innumerable, not only from a long-term perspective,
but, in certain cases, even in the current situation. By way of example,
here we can mention:

-  *Healthcare system*: diagnostic tools able to assist in the analysis
   of reports; integration of different sources and data merging;
   predictive tools to evaluate potential risks of disease evolution or
   to evaluate the effectiveness of therapies; patient assistance tools,
   able to follow them during treatment; precision medicine, for the
   identification of personalised treatments; better logistics
   organisation of healthcare structure activities.

-  *Citizen relations*: in the simplification of procedures and in order
   to obtain a two-way communication between PA and citizens and a
   personalised interaction in which citizens have all the necessary
   support to satisfy their most varied needs.

-  *Judicial system*: simplification of legislation; fraud
   identification; fight against corruption and crime, especially
   organised crime; reduction of civil litigation through easier access
   to legislation and jurisprudence; digitisation of documents and
   understanding of the text and information present.

-  *School system*: automatic evaluation tools; personalisation of
   teaching material; automated tutoring, by means of recommendation
   tools to maintain attention; suggestions concerning personalised
   variations to be introduced in the school programme; extraction of
   predictive indicators for school drop-out risk.

-  *Security*: AI amplifies the integrated impact of publicly available
   structured and unstructured data, thanks to which it can support
   advanced forms of management and prevention in the policing field.

-  *Public employment and placement*: organisation of personnel and
   careers; career counselling and management of internal processes and
   documentation.

-  *Mobility and transport*: traffic management, traffic and pollution
   predictive models, management of public transport logistics, but also
   autonomous transport solutions; real-time monitoring of sensor data.

-  *Tax system*: application of AI techniques to cases of suspected
   avoidance and evasion.

|                                                                       |
| The AI issue is decidedly vast and obviously every area of            |
| application has its own peculiarities and frontier research           |
| activities. By way of example, we mention those on so-called          |
| *one-shot learning*, i.e. the ability to learn from a single example, |
| and reinforcement learning to learn behaviour strategies; finally     |
| *Strong AI*, linked to *Neuro Evolution* and *Brain Intelligence*.    |
| *Neuro Evolution* is about simulating something similar to            |
| self-consciousness. *Brain Intelligence*, on the other hand, is a     |
| very promising technique that has the aim of creating AI systems that |
| communicate spontaneously with each other. In this way, it is hoped   |
| to solve three problems typical of Artificial Intelligence (in the    |
| sense of “generalised intelligence”):                                 |
|                                                                       |
| -  that of the **frame** (it is not enough to know how to win at      |
|    chess or be able to write journalistic articles that make sense    |
|    starting from big data, but it is necessary to know how to do      |
|    these two things together with many others);                       |
|                                                                       |
| -  the **associative problem** (AI does not know how to make          |
|    spontaneous associations, as man does, but it needs men to do this |
|    for it);                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| -  the **symbolic problem** (AI cannot understand what the signs it   |
|    is processing mean, but only those that statistically recur with   |
|    other signs). [4]_                                                 |

   Research on so-called Full Intelligence and Strong AI, in terms of
   both Neuro Evolution (NE) and Brain Intelligence (BI), is still in
   its infancy.

.. [2]
   Typically those that, in the perceptive (sight and hearing),
   deductive (reasoning, planning, decision-making, game strategies),
   analysis, execution (movement, manipulation) and interaction (use of
   natural language) sphere, require no more than a second to provide a
   response to an external stimulus.
