Challenge 2: Technology
-----------------------

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently not able to reproduce the complex functioning of the human mind [1]_, but only approximate some limited abilities [2]_, it is a discipline that has evolved over sixty years of scientific, methodological and technological research and become pervasive in industry and society. AI models and methods can certainly help develop innovative solutions in complex sociotechnical systems, such as that of the Public Administration.

Studies and research on how AI systems can effectively cooperate with human beings are of paramount importance to the public sector.
This approach focuses on AI machine learning and adaptation capabilities to provide a human machine interaction that best meets the needs of users and their interests.

Therefore, it is urgent to conduct research based on methodological investigation, modelling, implementation and testing Artificial Intelligence systems in across different domains of the Public Administration.

Linguistic technologies (Natural Language Processing - NLP) are certainly pivotal and represent the basis of a large number of applications that fall within Artificial Intelligence. The deployment of these technologies, based today to a large extent on Open Source software, requires the availability of specific text (e.g. annotated corpora), lexicographical and semantic (e.g. wordnet) datasets, as well as the spread of specialized skills to manage the introduction of these technologies in different sectors of the Public Administration (i.e. health, justice, finance).

The lack or unavailability of adequate resources for processing and understanding the Italian language, together with a lack of skills, could cause both a loss of competitiveness compared to other nations, and a dependence on platforms and solutions provided by a restricted number of subjects operating under monopoly conditions.

The distinctive characteristics of the “technological challenge” can therefore be linked to two keywords: “personalisation” and “adaptability”.
In fact, to overcome this challenge it is required to create public systems and services based on the multiple needs of citizens, able to evolve with them and to encourage personalised experiences.

This issue can be approached analytically by linking the most developed sectors and technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence with the typical activities and tasks of the Public Administration. “Intelligent” technologies [3]_ are broadly used in the public sector.

For instance [4]_ here we can mention:

 - *Healthcare system*: diagnostic tools able to support the analysis of medical reports; integration of different sources
   and data  merging; epidemiological analysis to identify public health risks; instant translation services to facilitate
   communication with foreign patients in hospitals; predictive tools to evaluate potential risks of disease evolution or to
   evaluate the effectiveness of therapies; patient assistance tools to support them during treatment; precision medicine to
   identify personalised treatments; better logistics organisation of healthcare structure activities.
   
-  *Citizen relations*: simplification of procedures to obtain a two-way communication between PA and citizens 
   and a personalised interaction that allow citizens to satisfy their needs.
   
-  *Judicial system*:simplification of legislation; fraud identification; fighting against corruption and crime,
   especially organised crime; reduction of civil litigation; digitisation of documents.

-  *School system*: automatic evaluation tools; personalisation of teaching material; automated tutoring; suggestions
   on personalised school curricula; predictive indicators for school drop-out risk.
   
-  *Security*: AI amplifies the integrated impact of publicly available structured and unstructured data thus 
   supporting advanced forms of management and prevention of crime.

-  *Public employment and placement*: career counselling and management of internal processes and documentation.

-  *Mobility and transport*: traffic management, traffic and pollution predictive models, management of public 
   transport logistics, autonomous transport solutions; real-time monitoring of sensor data.

-  *Tax system*: application of AI techniques to identify cases of potential tax avoidance and evasion.
   
-  *Environmental monitoring*:  the use of machine learning algorithms to improve 5G wireless sensor data (e.g. video
   cameras, radioactivity detectors, chemicals, temperature, brightness, humidity, etc.) could allow monitoring and 
   intercepting critical events (e.g. automatic search of events on video surveillance data combined with chemical detection 
   analysis to identify eco-crimes such as spills of harmful substances, or to define indicators for fires, floods, collapses, etc.).
