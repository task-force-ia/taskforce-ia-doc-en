Challenge 2: Technology
-----------------------

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently not able to reproduce the complex functioning of the human mind [1]_, but only approximate some limited abilities [2]_, it is a discipline which, acquired over sixty years of scientific, methodological and technological research, has become pervasive in industry and society. Its models and methods can certainly be 
conveniently used as tools for the implementation of innovative solutions in complex sociotechnical systems, such as that of public administrations, provided that, together with the opportunities, the limits of their scope of application are understood.

The new frontiers of particular interest for Public Administration are those related to studies and research on how AI systems are able to cooperate in the most effective way with human beings. 
This approach exploits AI machine learning and adaptation capabilities to provide a humanmachine interaction that best meets the needs of users, their interests and the real context in which they operate. 
Therefore, It becomes important to conduct research consisting of methodological investigation, modelling, implementation and testing of Artificial Intelligence systems for various domains of interest to PA.

Linguistic technologies (Natural Language Processing - NLP) are certainly of great interest and are the basis of a large number of applications that fall within Artificial Intelligence. The deployment of these technologies, based today to a large extent on Open Source software, requires the availability of specific text datasets (ex. annotated corpora), lexicographical and semantic (ex. wordnet), as well as the dissemination of specialized skills necessary to manage training and adaptation processes to various areas of application (ex. health, justice, finance). 
The lack or unavailability of adequate resources for the Italian language, together with a lack of skills in the use of NLP technologies, could cause both a loss of competitiveness compared to other nations, and a dependence on platforms and solutions provided by a restricted number of subjects operating under monopoly conditions.

The distinctive characteristics of the “technological challenge” can therefore be identified by two keywords: “personalisation” and “adaptability”.

In fact, the overcoming of this challenge means to be able to create PA systems and services modelled on the multiple needs of citizens, able to evolve with them, able to encourage personalised experiences.

This issue can be approached analytically by linking the most developed sectors and technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence with the activities and tasks typical of Public Administration.

The areas of use of “intelligent” technologies [3]_ in Public Administration are innumerable, not only from a long-term perspective, but, in certain cases, even in the current situation. 

For example [4]_ here we can mention:

-  *Healthcare system*: Diagnostic tools able to assist in the analysis of reports; integration of different sources and 
   data merging; epidemiological analysis to identify public health risks early; instant translation 
   services to facilitate hospital and territorial medical visits to foreigners; predictive tools to 
   evaluate potential risks of disease evolution or to evaluate the effectiveness of therapies; 
   patient assistance tools, able to follow them during treatment; precision medicine, for 
   the identification of personalised treatments; better logistics organisation of healthcare 
   structure activities.
   
-  *Citizen relations*: In the simplification of procedures and in order to obtain a two-way communication 
   between PA and citizens and a personalised interaction in which citizens have all the necessary
   support to satisfy their most varied needs.

-  *Judicial system*: Simplification of legislation; fraud identification; fight against corruption and crime, 
   especially organised crime; reduction of civil litigation through easier access to legislation 
   and jurisprudence; digitisation of documents and understanding of the text and information 
   present.

-  *School system*: Automatic evaluation tools; personalisation of teaching material; automated tutoring, by 
   means of recommendation tools to maintain attention; suggestions concerning personalised 
   variations to be introduced in the school programme; extraction of predictive indicators for 
   school drop-out risk

-  *Security*: AI amplifies the integrated impact of publicly available structured and unstructured data, 
   thanks to which it can support advanced forms of management and prevention in the 
   policing field.

-  *Public employment and placement*: Organisation of employees and careers; career counselling and management of internal 
   processes and documentation.

-  *Mobility and transport*: Traffic management, traffic and pollution predictive models, management of public transport 
   logistics, but also autonomous transport solutions; real-time monitoring of sensor data

-  *Tax system*: Application of AI techniques to identify cases of potential tax avoidance and evasion through 
   the analysis and crossover of data from different sectors of the state.
   
-  *Environmental monitoring*: the use of machine learning algorithms on 5G wireless sensor data (ex. video cameras,
   radioactivity detectors, chemicals, temperature, brightness, humidity, etc.) could allow
   monitoring and intercepting critical events in the territory (ex. automatic search of events
   on video surveillance data combined with chemical detection analysis to identify eco-crimes
   such as spills of harmful substances, similarly possible to define indicators for fires, floods,
   collapses, etc.).
