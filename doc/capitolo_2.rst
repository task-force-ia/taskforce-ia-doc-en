Chapter 2 - Artificial intelligence today
-----------------------------------------

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? There are many definitions, among
which that of the University of Stanford, which identifies it as “a
science and a set of computational techniques that are inspired - albeit
typically operating in a different way - by the way in which human
beings use their nervous system and their body to feel, learn, reason
and act” [1]_.

Novels and science fiction films use and exacerbate the fear of the
unknown to fear of the unknown: Artificial Intelligence is often
represented in a negative way, as a danger to humanity, potentially
capable of taking over and dominating us [2]_ but in reality AI is
already part of our daily life. With the digital assistants of mobile
phones, autonomous cars, *chatbots* that respond when we call public or
private entities, machine translation systems, robots used in
factories/industrial robots, algorithms that suggest us products and
services and those that assist us in learning, or increasingly realistic
and engaging video games.

Artificial Intelligence, for example, can improve our lives by driving
our vehicles, or take care of elderly people in need of assistance,
carry out dangerous and arduous jobs, help people make informed
decisions, rationally manage large amounts of data that would otherwise
be difficult to interpret, allow people to communicate while not knowing
the language of our interlocutors, support research, increase cultural
and entertainment experiences, and speed up bureaucratic procedures.

This is possible in certain specific application areas [3]_ thanks to
recent developments in AI techniques, essentially due to the wide
availability of annotated data, to the improvement in learning
techniques and to the availability of high computational capacity at
increasingly accessible costs.

The main application areas 
---------------------------

There are already examples of how PAs can benefit from adopting AI
solutions; among these we already see effects and applications in the
health, education and judiciary systems, as well as in public
employment, security and, in general, in the management of relationships
with citizens.

In this latter field, Artificial Intelligence can be used to answer
questions, query and process documents, fill in forms, correctly route
various types of requests or translate texts [4]_.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Box                                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| A *chatbot* equipped with AI can respond simultaneously to            |
| multiple conversations, eliminating queues. Once having understood    |
| the needs of its interlocutor, this technology can direct him/her to  |
| the right departments, help the individual find the needed            |
| documentation, provide instructions to correctly submit written       |
| requests, if necessary also speak in a foreign language, or translate |
| the bureaucratic terms that the user might not understand.            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Public officials can be freed from answering the simplest questions and
tasks, which are often the most recurring, enabling them to save time
and use it for providing complex advice and better services.

Some of the functionalities described can also be used in healthcare, to
speed medical examinations and tests. Research into robots that take
care of patients is producing innovative results as they can memorise
dosage and timing to administrate medicines, or monitor the patient’
state of health by means of biometric measurements to be transmitted to
the doctor, even accompanied by a possible diagnostic hypothesis.

Precisely this type of situation, which could lend itself to significant
ethical and scientific controversies or to potential conflicts of
interests between patients and doctors [5]_, highlights a focal point in
which AI is excellently positioned, with its ability to create
unprecedented interactions between administrative-technological systems
and human beings.

Moreover, it is already possible to imagine programming intelligent
systems that read tests results and interpret them, based on the
statistics conducted on large amounts of similar data and on their
meaning [6]_. There are even predictive tools to assess potential risks
of evolution of individual diseases. Precision medicine, research on
personalised treatments and analyses on the possible effects of certain
drugs on individual patients are all fields that promise great results,
thanks to the ability of Artificial Intelligence to store and process a
large amount of information on patients. At the same time, the use of AI
in these fields requires both careful monitoring by the medical
community and strict observance of privacy.

Something very similar is happening in schools, where artificial
teaching assistants are already available, able to follow students
individually, giving them content and concepts selected to help them
develop their skills, deepen their knowledge, or bridge the gap with
their fellow students [7]_.

These tools can be used by Public Administration for staff training,
career management and internal organisation.

The security sector can also benefit from the development of Artificial
Intelligence technologies. For example, in the surveillance field, with
computer vision and natural language processing systems that can process
large amounts of images, texts and speeches, to detect possible threats
in real time [8]_. Or in the environmental disaster prevention field,
where it is possible to perform natural phenomena simulations that can
help authorities to decide how to intervene [9]_. Similar technologies
can also be used by law enforcement agencies, to patrol cities, based on
continuously updated data, linked to the crimes committed in the various
areas and to other significant variables.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Box                                                                   |
|                                                                       |
| One of the main problems in all these areas is that of **guaranteeing |
| the security of the AI systems**: entry of an attacker in systems     |
| that, for example, will be able to drive a bus, could jeopardize the  |
| lives of those on board, as too could tampering with the surveillance |
| tools of a public place make it vulnerable to attacks, or knowledge,  |
| by a hacker, of the model used by the Artificial Intelligence for the |
| management of sensitive data, could make such data insecure. To       |
| effectively address these issues, it is necessary to put in place     |
| various solutions, some of a technical nature, others of a more       |
| general nature, raising awareness among citizens and administrations. |
| From a technical point of view, it is important to work to ensure     |
| that, by law, certain standards are guaranteed, both for the security |
| of the data used by the algorithms, as well as for the security of    |
| the algorithms themselves, imposing that, for their implementation,   |
| the *security by design* [10]_ paradigm is always followed.           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Finally, also public decision makers can use intelligent algorithms,
capable of processing large amounts of data, for example on the
resources available in disadvantaged areas, or on the progress of the
various sectors - health, judicial, scholastic, agri-food, etc. -, in
order to obtain a clearer view of the choices they must or want to
accomplish. It is possible, as they are experimenting in Japan [11]_,
that personnel in public offices respond in a personalised manner to all
citizen requests, using adequately instructed Artificial Intelligence
tools, which automatically produce the contents to be sent.

It will be up to the administrations to decide how to use the resources
freed up by the introduction of these new technologies, in a range of
options that include the qualitative improvement of services and the
reduction of costs for their operation.

The potential of AI in Public Administration
--------------------------------------------

The potential of Artificial Intelligence for Public Administration is
manifold. Nevertheless, the scientific community and public opinion
highlight some critical issues that must be taken into account in order
to prevent distorted effects in the application of these tools and
technologies.

With reference to machine learning systems, today bias [12]_ that affect
the AI “reasoning” and lead it into error [13]_ are produced both by the
data that feed an AI and/or by its algorithms.

Making predictions with inadequately designed tools can only lead to
wrong and, in many cases, even ethically incorrect decisions [14]_.

Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that, currently, Artificial
Intelligence is able to carry out, with a certain precision, a small
number of cognitive activities [15]_ referring to specific sectoral
domains, generally lacking background knowledge.

If correctly designed and used, AI technologies can in fact guarantee
concrete prospects for improving the quality of life. In the
relationship between citizens and public administration, these
technologies will be able to allow greater accessibility to public
services, facilitating a substantial reduction in their costs, with
benefits in terms of reduction of social spending, which can thus be
reallocated. In perspective, it will be possible to enhance many
procedures with adequate automation, offering citizens the opportunity
to interact with the State in a more agile, effective and personalised
way. We will all benefit from this, including the elderly, the disabled
and these citizens belonging to disadvantaged categories. This will
allow Public Administration to recover and strengthen the relationship
of trust with the community. In order to encourage this recovery,
introducing technologies such as AI in PA requires not only technical
and administrative interventions, but also systemic, narrative and
aesthetic ones, capable of generating meaning and involvement.

PA may also use AI methodologies and technologies to support the
rationalisation and integration of its databases, in a perspective of
semantic interoperability that makes it easier to circulate information
between administrations to the benefit of end users [16]_.

AI will also affect the redefinition of the relationship between public
and private with a view to greater transparency through the
implementation of e-procurement practices. Among the areas that in the
next decade will benefit from the AI revolution, in fact, will be
precisely that of public procurement.

   border controls with a technology based on biometric detection
   carried out by 80 cameras appropriately positioned inside a tunnel -
   on whose walls immersive videos will be projected - in which all
   passengers will be invited to pass after having been identified with

   An example is the simulation of the effects of tornadoes and other
   natural events, together with the processing of data produced by the
   collection stations during the events themselves, solutions that have
   in many cases helped the authorities to make decisions about where
   and how to intervene.

   In essence, this paradigm requires that security is pursued already
   when designing Artificial Intelligence databases and algorithms.

   The term “bias” (literally “prejudice”) has multiple meanings. In the
   statistical field, as well as in many machine-learning applications,
   “bias” has a different meaning from the popular and social/scientific
   meaning. For example, the idea of “selection bias” refers to
   estimation errors that are determined when certain members of a
   population are more likely to be sampled than others. When a
   machine-learning program is trained, for example, to recognise the
   faces of a particular race and is subsequently applied to larger or
   simply different populations, it can produce distorted results and
   have a lower measure of accuracy. The word “bias” also has normative
   meanings in both colloquial and legal language, where it refers to a
   judgment based on notions or prejudices, in contrast to an impartial
   assessment of the facts (*See* AI NOW 2017 Report, p. 14 “\ *Bias and
   inclusion*\ ” -
   `https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.pdf <https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2017_Report.pdf>`__).

   For example, natural language processing techniques formed on a
   corpus of writing extracted from the web of the 1990s may reflect
   associations of stereotyped words that are no longer current: the
   word “female” could in fact be associated with “receptionist”. If the
   models built with such logical assumptions are used to make decisions
   in the educational field or in the world of work, for example in
   terms of recruitment, we are in the presence of a case in which
   existing disparities can even be strengthened, regardless of the
   intentions or knowledge of the system designers (*See* AINOW 2017
   Report, p. 4 “Bias and inclusion”).

   There are many cases of Artificial Intelligence applications that can
   reproduce the social prejudices of those who have instructed them or
   those who have programmed them, establishing, for example, that it is
   preferable to submit more remunerative job offers to men rather than
   address them to women, because usually it is the former who have the
   highest salaries, or that it is preferable to offer a loan to a white
   male in a particular district rather than a black male in another, or
   that it is not wise to offer probation to certain prisoners belonging
   to particular ethnic groups, because usually their recidivism is very
   high.
