Chapter 2 - Artificial intelligence today
=========================================

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Among many definitions of AI, the University of Stanford describes it as “a science and a set of computational techniques that are inspired - albeit typically operating in a different way - by the way in which human beings use their nervous system and their body to feel, learn, reason and act” [1]_.

Novels and science fiction use and exacerbate the fear of the unknown: Artificial Intelligence is often represented in a negative way, as a danger to humanity, potentially capable of taking over and dominating [2]_ us, whereas AI is already a part of our daily life.

With the digital assistants of mobile phones, autonomous cars, *chatbots* [3]_ that respond when we call public or private entities, machine translation systems, industrial robots, algorithms that suggest products and services to us and those that assist us in learning, or increasingly realistic and engaging video games.

Artificial Intelligence, for example, can improve our lives by driving our vehicles, taking care of elderly people in need of assistance, carrying out dangerous and arduous jobs, helping us make informed decisions, rationally managing large amounts of data that would otherwise be difficult to interpret, allowing us to communicate while not knowing the language of our interlocutors, increasing cultural and entertainment experiences and speeding up bureaucratic procedures.

This is possible in certain specific application areas [4]_ thanks to recent developments in AI techniques, essentially due to the wide availability of annotated data, to the improvement in learning techniques and to the availability of high computational capacity at increasingly accessible costs.


The main application areas 
--------------------------

There are already examples of how PA can benefit from adopting AI solutions; among these we already see effects and applications in the health, education and judiciary system, in public employment, security and, in general, in the management of relationships with citizens.

In this latter field, Artificial Intelligence can be used to answer questions, to query databases, to process documents, fill in forms, to correctly route various requests or to translate texts [5]_.

|                                                                                            |
| A chatbot equipped with AI can respond simultaneously                                      |
| to conversations that come at a given time, eliminating queues and. Once                   |
| having understood the needs of its interlocutor, this technology can direct him/her        |
| to theright departments,                                                                   |
| help the user find the documentation, provide instructions to correctly submit             |
| written requests, if necessary it can also speak in a foreign language,                    |
| or translate the bureaucratic terms that the user does not understand.                     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Civil servants can be freed from answering the simplest questions, which are often the most recurring, enabling them to save time and use it for providing complex advice and better services.

Some of the functionalities described can also be used in healthcare, for instance, to speed up medical examinations and tests.
Research into robots that take care of patients is producing innovative results, as they can memorise the dosage and timing to administer medicines, or monitor the patient's state of health by means of biometric measurements to be transmitted to the doctor, even accompanied by a possible diagnostic hypothesis.

This is an example of how the use of AI solutions can lead to significant ethical and scientific controversies or to potential conflicts of interests between patients and doctors. At the same time, this example shows how AI can create unprecedented interactions between administrative-technological systems and human beings.

Moreover, it is already possible to imagine programming intelligent systems that read tests results and interpret them, based on the statistics conducted on large amounts of similar data [6]_. There are even predictive tools to assess potential risks of evolution of individual diseases.

Precision medicine, research on personalized treatments, analysis on the possible effects of certain drugs on individual patients are all fields that promise great results, thanks to the ability of Artificial Intelligence to store and process a large amount of information on patients. At the same time, the use of AI in these fields requires both careful monitoring by the medical community and strict observance of privacy, ethical and professional standards [7]_.

Something very similar is happening in schools, where artificial teaching assistants are already available, able to follow students individually, suggest them certain contents and concepts selected to develop their skills, deepen their knowledge, or bridge the gap with their fellow students [8]_.

These tools can be used by Public Administration for staff training, career management and internal organisation.
The security sector can also benefit from the development of Artificial Intelligence technologies. For instance, in the field of surveillance computer vision and natural language processing systems can process large amounts of images, texts and speeches, to detect possible threats in real time; in the field of environmental disaster prevention, it is possible to perform natural phenomena simulations that can help authorities decide how to intervene. Law enforcement agencies can also use similar technologies to patrol cities, relying on continuously updated data, linked to the crimes committed in the various areas and to other significant variables.

Finally, also public decision makers can use intelligent algorithms, capable of processing large amounts of data, on the resources available in disadvantaged areas, or on the progress of the various sectors - health, judicial, scholastic, agri-food, etc. - in order to make more informative choices. It is possible, as they are experimenting in Japan [9]_ that personnel in public offices give personalised responses to citizens, using adequately instructed Artificial Intelligence tools, which automatically produce the contents to be sent.

It will be up to the administrations to decide how to use the resources freed up by the introduction of these new technologies, in a range of options that include the qualitative improvement of services and the reduction of costs for their operation.

|                                                                                                                          |
| One of the main problems in all these areas is that of guaranteeing the security of the AI systems:                      |
| a hacking attack to the systems that, for instance, will be able to drive a bus, could endanger the lives                |
| of people on board. In the same way, tampering with the surveillance tools of a public place makes it vulnerable         |
| to attacks, or knowledge, by a hacker, of the model used by the Artificial Intelligence for the management of            |
| sensitive data, could make such data insecure.To effectively address these issues, it is necessary to put in place       |
| various solutions, raising awareness among citizens and administrations.                                                 |
| From a technical point of view, it is important to work to ensure that certain standards                                 |
| are guaranteed by the law, both for the security of the data used by the algorithms, and for the security of the         |
| algorithms themselves, imposing that, for their implementation, the security by design paradigm is always followed [10]_ |

The potential of AI in Public Administration
--------------------------------------------

The potential of Artificial Intelligence for the Public Administration is manifold. Nevertheless, the scientific community and public opinion highlight some critical issues that must be taken into account in order to prevent distorted effects in the application of these tools and technologies.

With reference to machine learning systems, today bias that affects the AI “reasoning” [11]_ and leads it into error is produced both by data that feeds an AI system and by its algorithms. 

Making predictions with inadequately designed tools can only lead to wrong and, in many cases, even ethically incorrect decisions [12]_.
Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that, currently, Artificial Intelligence is able to carry out, with a certain precision, a small number of cognitive activities [13]_ related to specific sectoral domains, generally lacking background knowledge.

If correctly designed and implemented, AI technologies can in fact guarantee concrete prospects for improving the quality of life. In the relationship between citizens and Public Administration, AI will be able to allow greater accessibility to public services, facilitating a substantial reduction in their costs, with benefits in terms of reduction of social spending, which can thus be reallocated. It will be possible to enhance many procedures with adequate automation, offering citizens the opportunity to interact with the State in a more agile, effective and personalised way.

We will all benefit from this, including the elderly, the disabled and disadvantaged groups. This will allow Public Administration to strengthen the trust relationship with the community. The achievement of this goal will require technical, administrative, systemic, narrative and aesthetic interventions, capable of generating meaning and people involvement.

PA may also use AI methodologies and technologies to support the rationalisation and integration of its databases, in a perspective of semantic interoperability that makes it easier to circulate information between administrations to the benefit of end-users [14]_.
The enormous wealth of knowledge generated and collected over time in such databases is often “invisible”, because unstructured, dispersed in multiple archives and largely in the memory of people rather than of the organization. Making this “invisible knowledge” visible is one of the potential and most promising areas of application of AI in the PA with solutions able to read, understand and classify the contents of documents and reports produced over decades to obtain the most relevant information.

AI will also affect the relationship between public and private with a view to greater transparency through the implementation of e-procurement practices. Among the areas that in the next decade will benefit from the AI revolution, in fact, will be precisely that of public procurement.
